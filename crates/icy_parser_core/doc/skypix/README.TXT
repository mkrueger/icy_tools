As of Release 1.11, I have begun including a .TXT version of the ANSI.guide
generated using the AG2TXT program by Jason Hulance.  This file is useful for
users of other computer platforms, BBS SysOps who would like an on-line version
of the file, and for Amiga users without access to AmigaGuide (tsk tsk.)
