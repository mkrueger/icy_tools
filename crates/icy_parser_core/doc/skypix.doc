When this document was first released almost two years ago, the tide of
SysOps converting their BBS's from Commodore to Amiga was reaching its
peak.  At that time, SkyLine 1.3 was the hottest Amiga BBS around (because
of its unique SkyPix protocol.)  Michael Cox, however, decided to release
Version 2.0 without SkyPix implementation, and some would say that the
decline of SkyLine's popularity began there.  Fortunately for SkyPix fans
such as myself, however, C-Net Amiga now supports the protocol, providing
a viable outlet for it until a better graphic-oriented protocol becomes
ubiquitous in the Amiga market (such as RIP for instance.)

TO C-NET USERS: the ANSI portion of this document is basically useless to
you (other than as a technical reference), since C-Net's [M]essage
[C]ommand [I]nterpreter mirrors all of the standard [7mANSI commands[0m.
However, SkyPix commands are not covered by MCI, and BBS artists must still
enter them the old-fashioned way (or with [7mSKYPAINT[0m.)  As of version 2.63,
the only way to use ANSI/SkyPix while on-line is through the line editor
(the visual editor will not respond to ESC sequences for some reason, but
this may have been fixed in CNet/3.)  Also, you must press ESC twice for
the code to register with the editor (the ESC code will show as a
tilde ~.)

TO SKYLINE 1.3 USERS: this document contains commands to which SkyLine's
built-in editor should (I said SHOULD) respond, and since SkyLine has no
equivalent of MCI, these Escape-commands provide the only method of
changing colour and adding other various effects from within the BBS.


OK, BUT JUST EXACTLY WHAT IS ANSI?
==================================

ANSI is actually an organisation, the American National Standards
Institute, which back in the stone ages decided to introduce
hardware/software standards to make the job of persons in the computer
industry easier.  Originally, the ANSI protocol governed printer-to-
computer communications since monitors were rare at that time.
Eventually, however, someone invented the CRT, and ANSI seemed a logical
choice to govern text displays on this new device.  When MS-DOS came into
being in the 1970's, MicroSoft picked up on the ANSI standard (implemented
in ANSI.SYS) to allow non-graphics-capable machines (this was before CGA)
to generate pseudo-graphic displays using text and ANSI colour changes.
Then came the 80's and the era of the modem, and some clever programmer
grabbed the standard once again to use for data terminal emulations,
providing SysOps and users with on-line "pictures", colour changes, and
cursor movement which made BBS'ing more interesting.  The word "ANSI" can
refer to a variety of standards (such as ANSI C, for instance), but for
now I will refer to only the data terminal implementation.

The ANSI protocol is functionally similar to Commodore's Pet ASCII in that
each command is implemented by a series of weird characters that no one in
their right mind would ever type by mistake.  Also like PetSCII, it is
designed so that terminal and host should (ideally) respond identically
to the same command (this is rarely the case, however.)  Since all 16-
colour ANSI terminals (including ones on the Amiga) are designed to
emulate the [7mstandard ANSI palette[0m, it is possible to view the
same graphics using vastly different machines.

Standard ANSI Commands are structured as Introducer + Command + Terminator
where the Introducer is almost always the ESC [ key sequence and the
Terminator is generally a letter (ANSI) or an exclamation point (SkyPix.)

Confused yet?

The ";" key can also be used within a [7mcomplex command[0m to join 2 command
strings together.  I know this sounds awfully naughty and complex, but
just study the command charts in the following section and I think you'll
see where I'm driving.  The key sequences are spelled out key-for-key (they
must be entered exactly.)

NOTES:
------
· [ ]  -  refers to optional parts of a command.

· '[n]' or '[m]'  -  always decimal numbers, containing one or more ASCII
  digits to express their value.

· Where '[n]' occurs in a command and the value of 'n' is not explicitly
  defined, it usually defaults to 1.

· 'ESC'  -  an ESCape key press (HEX $1B or DECIMAL 27) - Use CTRL-[ if you
  don't have an ESCape key (Commodore 64's, for instance) - in some
  implementations, $DB also works as a command introducer, but ESC is much
  more widely-used

· Commands involving upper or lower-case letters are always case-sensitive.

· Where applicable, the equivalent C-Net MCI commands (version 2.0 and
  beyond) have been included for reference.

· All sequences should be entered WITHOUT SPACES - the spaces are included
  for readability only.

[1mText F/X, or Emphasis Made Easy[0m

TEXT F/X
========

Normal Display (clear all F/X)                                    ESC [ 0 m

  (turns off reverse, brightness, and boldface; sets text and background to
  [7mdefault colours[0m.  In SkyPix, this will also reset the [7mfont[0m to Topaz-8.)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Activate Bright Colours (STANDARD ANSI ONLY)                      ESC [ 1 m

  (forces the next [7mcolour change[0m to use the second 8 colours instead of
  the first.  This command is ignored in SkyPix mode.)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Activate Italics (STANDARD ANSI ONLY)                             ESC [ 3 m

  (This only worked on a few terminals I tried.)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Activate Boldface (STANDARD ANSI ONLY) [MCI \o1]                  ESC [ 5 m

  (This command is also ignored in SkyPix mode.)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Reverse Display [MCI \r1]                                         ESC [ 7 m

  (interchanges the background and foreground colours.)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

FLASHING TEXT AND OTHER STUFF
=============================

Many of the above commands are dependent upon the terminal used.  For
instance, on many IBM terminals Boldface text (ESC [ 5 m) appears
instead as flashing (blinking) characters.  On other terminals, the
(ESC [ 1 m) command activates flashing text instead of turning on bright
colours (TERM, for instance, uses flashing text to represent the second
8 colours on 8-colour (3 bit-plane) screens.)  Still others represent the
second 8 colours by Boldface text.  You will need to experiment to figure
out how your terminal implements each of the above commands.

CHANGING COLOURS
================

NOTES:
------
· If Reverse Display is activated, the foreground colour becomes the
  background colour

· In SkyPix mode, the first 8 colours can be accessed with standard ANSI
  commands (to allow compatibility with ANSI screens), however the second
  8 SkyPix colours can only be accessed by changing the SkyPix [7mPen Colour[0m,
  which is discussed later in this text.

· Only the first 8 colours may be used as a background.

· The foreground and background colours can be mixed and matched to achieve
  128 total colour combinations.

AMIGA IMPLEMENTATIONS
=====================

For Amiga terminals, the accepted standard ANSI palette (which most closely
approximates the original CGA text colours) is as follows:

        R   G   B    COLOUR          |        R   G   B    COLOUR
  -----------------------------------+-----------------------------------
   0 =  00  00  00   Black           |   8 =  06  06  06   Dark Grey
   1 =  10  00  00   Red             |   9 =  15  00  00   Bright Red
   2 =  00  10  00   Green           |  10 =  00  15  00   Bright Green
   3 =  10  06  00   Orange          |  11 =  15  15  00   Yellow
   4 =  00  00  10   Dark Blue       |  12 =  00  00  15   Bright Blue
   5 =  10  00  10   Violet          |  13 =  15  00  15   Bright Violet
   6 =  00  10  10   Cyan            |  14 =  00  15  00   Bright Cyan

Often in generating long ANSI screens with many [7mcolour changes[0m, it is
important to consider the time that the screen will take to display over
the modem (especially at 2400 baud.)  Programmes like [7mBBS-DRAW[0m will
automatically generate 'smart' ANSI code which transmits in the least
amount of time possible, but generating such code by hand takes a little
bit of ingenuity on the part of the BBS artist.

The first thing to bear in mind when generating 'smart' code is that any
two (or more) ANSI codes which have the same command [7mterminator[0m may be
combined into a single command.

Example:  To set the text to bright cyan and the background to violet on an
          ANSI screen,

either enter     ESC [ 1 m    then    ESC [ 36 m    then    ESC [ 45 m
    or enter     ESC [ 1; 36 ; 45 m

where the ; is the division character in the combined command, and the "m"
is the common terminator of the three combined commands.  As you can see,
the second, 'optimised,' code contains four fewer characters than the first
(those characters can add up after a while.)

Another thing to consider in optimising your code is that colour,
background, and text F/X changes remain in effect until they are removed
in some way (by another change or by resetting to defaults.)  So, if you
wanted a whole passage of text to have a bright purple foreground but
wanted to change backgrounds in the middle, it would only be necessary to
enter something such as:

  ESC [ 1 ; 35 ; 43 m This is a test of the
  ESC [ 44 m Emergency Broadcast System.

instead of entering

  ESC [ 1 ; 35 ; 43 m This is a test of the
  ESC [ 1 ; 35 ; 44 m Emergency Broadcast System

However, if for some reason you wanted the text of "Emergency Broadcast
System" to appear in dark purple instead of bright purple, you would need
to specify a longer command:

  ESC [ 1 ; 35 ; 43 m This is a test of the
  ESC [ 0 ; 35 ; 44 m Emergency Broadcast System

This is necessary since ESC [ 0 m not only turns off brightness but resets
the colour and background as well.


COMPLEX DICE
============

OK, let's take a quantum leap here.  Let's say you wanted to clear the
screen, jump down 14 lines, jump over 43 columns, change the text colour to
dark red, change the background colour to yellow, and then make your
machine quote Monty Python.

   CTRL-L                      clears the display
   ESC [ 14 B                  jumps down 14 lines
   ESC [ 43 C                  jumps over 43 lines
   ESC [ 7 ; 1 ; 33 ; 41 m     the only way to use a bright colour as a
                               background is through Reverse Mode

   type "I didn't expect a kind of [7mSpanish Inquisition[0m!"

SkyPix is defined as a sub-set of the ANSI standard, and in fact most ANSI
commands have the same effect in SkyPix mode.  There are however several
SkyPix-specific commands (each followed with a characteristic "!" [bang]
terminator) which can only be used from a terminal equipped to emulate the
SkyPix protocol (all 2 of 'em ;)

NOTES:
------
· All SkyPix graphics are implemented on a default screen of 640x200
  (8 colours) with the [7mdefault palette[0m described below (unless the palette
  or number of number of [7mbitplanes[0m is changed.)

· All sequences should be entered WITHOUT SPACES - the spaces are included
  for readability only.

    A = upper-left X coord. of the source bitmap
    B = upper-left Y coord. of the source bitmap

    The above two will usually be 0.  HOWEVER, you can use these to blit
    parts of a brush to the screen.

    C = upper-left X coord. of the destination (the screen X coord.)
    D = upper-left Y coord. of the destination (the screen Y coord.)
    E = horizontal (X) size of brush
    F = vertical (Y) size of brush
    G = MINTERM to be supplied to the blitter (commonly 192)
    H = MASK to be supplied to the blitter (commonly 255)

    The above commands blit what is in the brush buffer (following a
    [7mCRC Transfer[0m or a [7mGRAB BRUSH[0m command) - if no brush is found, the
    command aborts.

11- NEW PALETTE                 ESC [ 11 ; c1 ; c2 ; c3 ; ... ; c15 ; c16 !

    Sets the palette to the sixteen colours C1-C16 [you must enter all 16
    colours even if you are just in [7m8-colour mode[0m!]  The parameters C1-C16
    are decimal numbers arrived at in the following way:

    Take a grey, for instance, whose R-G-B value is 12-12-12.  Then convert
    that to C-C-C (since 12 is hex $0C).  Now take the hex number CCC and
    convert back into Decimal, which gives you 3276.

    NOTE: Unless you are a massochist, I'd suggest using [7mSKYPAINT[0m since it
    does all of the above automatically.  Even if you just need to set the
    palette, load up SKYPAINT and begin recording, go to the palette screen
    and set it to what you want, then end recording.  You can then look at
    the tiny file you created and tell what ESC [ 11 command is needed in
    your final project.

[1mIBM Graphics, or IBM ASCII's Better Half[0m

What is IBM Graphics?  Well, it's yet another throwback to the early IBM
days (as the name indicates.)  All IBM's and compatibles have a special
set of graphic characters built into the upper half of their ASCII table
(128-255) as a way for text-only programmes to make boxes, windows, lines,
and such.  Use of IBM Graphics found its way into terminals and BBS
programmes much like ANSI did.

Of course, the Amiga with its ROM-based windows environment had no need for
such primitive methods of generating graphics, but once Amiga terms started
emulating IBM ANSI the need for emulating the IBM ASCII table arose as
well.  Fortunately, all that was required was a special font containing all
of the necessary characters.


THE BBS END
===========

IBM Graphic characters can be generated easily in most [7mANSI editors[0m using
point-and-click gadgets, but they can also be generated the old-fashioned
way by using special key sequences entered in a text editor or terminal
which has an IBM Graphic font selected as its default.  An IFF-ILBM screen
showing the most commonly-used IBM Graphic characters and their associated
key sequences (assumes keymap 'usa0') has been included in this archive for
your viewing pleasure.  You can display it either by clicking below or by
using a viewer of your own devising.

[7m Click Here to View! [0m


THE TERMINAL END
================

USING IBM GRAPHICS WITH ANSI: To enable IBM Graphics on any Amiga terminal,
simply select an IBM Graphic font as the terminal's default text font.
(a good IBM font has been included in this archive for those who don't have
one.)  This information is generally entered in a requester somewhere in
the terminal's configuration.

USING IBM GRAPHICS WITH SKYPIX: This requires a bit more work, but believe
it or not, it's possible.  JR-COMM uses Pearl rather than Topaz-8 as its
default font in SkyPix mode, so all you need to do is replace Pearl with
an IBM Graphic font (such as the included CleanIBM.)  This is accomplished
simply by copying the '8' file from the FONTS:CleanIBM/ subdirectory into
the FONTS:Pearl/ subdirectory and running FixFonts (for good measure.)

NOTE: If your terminal has an option for 'High-Bit Stripping' or '8th-Bit
Stripping', it must be turned off for IBM Graphics to function.

You don't need an intricate understanding of the ANSI protocol to start
making pretty pictures.  All you really need is a good ANSI editor.  An
ANSI editor is something of a cross between a paint programme and a text
editor.  A good one is designed to provide the user with an easy-to-use,
intuition-based, DPaint-like format for 'drawing' ANSI screens and to do
most of the nuts-and-bolts ANSI code generation automatically.  For
instance, the user would simply click on a gadget to change text colours
rather than entering the full ANSI code.

For non-animated ANSI screens, I would highly recommend using [7mBBS-DRAW[0m.
It is extremely easy to use and is available through most Public Domain/
Shareware archives.  I have used this programme for close to a year and
have found that it generates code very nearly as 'smart' as my own with
only a very few exceptions (plus working with it is considerably easier
than pounding out ESC codes blindly in a text editor.)

I'd also highly recommend getting a copy of [7mSKYPAINT[0m.  SKYPAINT has the
virtue of being the only ANSI editor equipped to interpret and generate
standard SkyPix code.  It is also relatively versatile and easy to use and
it implements most of the [7mSkyPix commands[0m automatically using a
point-and-click gadget box.  At any rate, it's a GREAT DEAL faster than
trying to enter them by hand and you can see the immediate results of each
command as you create your file.

For ANSI animations (ANSI-Mations), I generally use [7mDIANE[0m (Digital
Intelligence Animation Editor.)  This programme also uses an intuition-
based interface, but it employs a clever device which treats each
character placed on the screen as a separate 'frame' in the animation,
allowing the user to move between 'frames,' add, and edit 'frames' much
like a real animation program.  Backdrops for the entire animation can
also be loaded.  The only drawback of DIANE is that it is limited to 8
colours, but it is still my first choice.

For the other end of the line, I would recommend getting [7mTERMINUS[0m v2 or
[7mTERM[0m v4 (Workbench 2 and above) for emulating IBM ANSI.  If you use
TERM, I would also recommend using the (included) xemibm.library, since it
seems to provide better ANSI compliance than TERM's built-in ANSI/VT-102
routines.  For SkyPix, [7mJR-COMM[0m is still your best bet.  SKYTERM is
another option, although (surprisingly enough, since Michael Cox wrote it)
it does not conform as well to the SkyPix standard as JR-COMM.  Most
SkyPix-supporting BBS's (mine included) are designed to work with JR-COMM
rather than SKYTERM.

      redistributable and can be found in most PD/ShareWare archives
  (including wuarchive.wustl.edu.)  The registered version can be ordered
 through the author for a ShareWare fee of $40 or for a $10 upgrade fee if
                    you are a registered JR-COMM user.

                TERMINUS and JR-COMM are also supported on

For SkyPix fans, I'm not sure whether Radigan still supports JR-COMM 1.02a
 or even if it is still available from his BBS.  However, the unregistered
    version of JR-COMM 1.02 or 1.02a (with the delay screen) is freely-
      redistributable and can be found in many Amiga archives such as
          wuarchive.wustl.edu and on most Amiga-supporting BBS's.

   JR-COMM 1.02a (unregistered) can also be found on the [A]miga [U]ser
 [I]nternational Userdisk #6 (11/91) Magazine Disk, and my BBS carries the
                   original archive as a free download.

SKYPAINT
========

SKYPAINT might be a little difficult to obtain.  Unfortunately, Michael Cox
limited its legal release to Registered SkyLine SysOps only (which is how I
acquired the programme.)  The legalities are a bit vague since he
abandonned the protocol, but I would assume that distributing SKYPAINT is
still technically a no-no.

Perhaps someone more proficient in programming than I could design a
freely-redistributable SkyPix editor and win my life-long friendship (hint
hint.)
