         d$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$    next, we take off  some characters
        :$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$    from the  left  side, or the  ride
        i$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$    side. it all depends on preference
         \$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$    but i  like the  left  side.  it's
          `4$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$    still in early stages, ergo, easy.

          ,Ús%##%s¿,,Ús%#%#s¿,
         d$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$d    this  is the  hard part.  copy the
        :$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$:   entire half of your heart and copy
        i$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$i   it. if you're  still  with me, you
         \$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$4    then reverse it and paste it right
          `4$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$4`     beside  your left(or right!) side.
