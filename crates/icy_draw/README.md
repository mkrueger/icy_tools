# IcyDraw

IcyDraw is the successor of MysticDraw an Ansi drawing tool I developed 1996 and last updated 2003. Due to lack on feedback I lost interest there.
Now 20 years later I've decided to give it an update and here it is.

IcyDraw is a full features ansi drawing tool doing things a bit different than other tools.

## Requires

IcyDraw needs a graphics card that can can do opengl 3.3+.
(It's the 2010 version but some people have problems starting)

If it doesn't run check if graphics card drivers are up to date.

On Windows:
opengl32.dll
And VCRUNTIME140.dll is required. Usually these two are installed and it should run out of the box. If you can run any game with 3D graphics it should just work.

## File structure

IcyDraw stores data only in one directory (~/.config/icy_draw on linux) - it doesn't scatter data around.

There are several folders:

| path           |  Description
|----------------|:----------------:|
| data/fonts/    | Stores bit fonts
| data/tdf/      | Stores tdf fonts
| data/palettes/ | Stores palettes
| data/plugins/  | Stores plugins
| autosave/      | Autosave data
| settings.json  | IcyDraw settings
| character_sets.json  | Character set mappings
| key_bindings.json  | Keybind settings
| recent_files.json  | MRU file list
| icy_draw.log   | IcyDraw log file

Note that fonts/palettes etc. do not need to be unzipped. Just throw a .zip file in there containing fonts and IcyDraw will pick them up.

## What it can't yet do, but potentially will be implemented

 - Full Unicode support
 - By layer transparency (esp. useful for animations - as well as by layer filters)
 - PETSCII, ATSCII and Viewdata - the engine can do it (see icy_term)
 - Server capabilities
